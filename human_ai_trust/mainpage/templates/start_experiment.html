<h2>Directions</h2>
	<p> 
        <b>Objective</b>: You will see a series of 50 patients and the objective is to diagnose them with a mysterious new flu-like illness called NOVID-20 as either (1) positive or (2) negative.<br>

        <b>Info</b>: For each patient, you will see information about their health, including presence of cough and chills, body temperature, blood pressure, and weight. Note: no prior knowledge of medicine is needed nor expected for these tasks. <br>

        <b>AI</b>: You will have the help of an AI tool that predicts whether each patient is positive or negative for NOVID-20. You can either choose to go with the AIâ€™s prediction or manually override and select the other diagnosis. <br>

        <b>Updating the AI</b>: The AI isn't always correct in diagnosing patients. When you disagree with the AI prediction, you can help the AI learn from its mistakes by clicking the update button. However, you will need to commit to updating the model before seeing whether or not the diagnosis was correct -- so think carefully!<i>Be warned, updating the AI when you are incorrect (and the model is correct) will lead to a decrease in its performance for future rounds</i><br>

        b>Points</b>: Everytime you diagnose a patient, you will be told whether your decision was right or wrong and how many points you gained. <i>Your objective is to maximize the number of points you have at the end</i>. For every correct diagnosis, you <i> gain 2 points</i> and for every incorrect diagnosis, you <i>lose 4 points</i>.
