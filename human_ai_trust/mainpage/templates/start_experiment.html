<!--         <b>Objective</b>:
        You will see a series of patients and the objective is to diagnose them with a mysterious new illness called NOVID-20 as either (1) positive or (2) negative. NOVID-20 is a life-threatening disease, misdiagnosis would be really bad for the patient. <br>

        <b>Information</b>:
        For each patient, you will see their chest X-Ray. Note: no prior knowledge of medicine is needed nor expected for these tasks. You might notice that the images get harder as time goes on, which may lead to a lower performance of the AI. <br>
 -->
        <!-- <b>AI</b>:
        You will have the help of an AI tool that predicts whether each patient is positive or negative for NOVID-20. You can either choose to go with the AIâ€™s prediction or manually override and select the other diagnosis. <br> -->


<!--         <b>Points</b>:
        Every time you diagnose a patient, you will be told whether your decision was right or wrong and how many points you gained. Your objective is to maximize the number of points you have at the end. For every correct diagnosis, you gain 20 points and for every incorrect diagnosis, you lose 40 points.
