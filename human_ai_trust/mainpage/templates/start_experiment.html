		<b>Objective</b>: You will see a series of 50 patients and the objective is to diagnose them as either (1) sick or (2) healthy.<br>

		<b>Info</b>: For each patient, you will see information about their health, including "insert features". Note: no prior knowledge of medicine is needed nor expected for these tasks. <br>

		<b>AI</b>: You will have the help of an AI tool that predicts whether each patient is sick or healthy. You can either choose to go with the AIâ€™s prediction or manually select an option. Everytime you diagnose a patient, you will be told whether your decision was right or wrong and how many points you gained. <br>

		<b>Updating the AI</b>: The AI isn't always correct in diagnosing patients. When you disagree with the AI prediction, you can help the AI learn from its mistakes by clicking the update button.  <br>

		<b>How to gain points</b>:
